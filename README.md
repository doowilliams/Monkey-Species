# Monkey-Species

### **Context:**
Several species of monkeys have become extinct in recent years. As a result, a wildlife sanctuary in the United States has taken an important step forward in gathering data on all species that are currently endangered. They have collected images of monkeys from several continents. However, it has become difficult for them to organize all of these images into their respective categories. They require a solution to identify these images into their relevant monkey species groups. As a data scientist, you have to create an efficient model to classify these images into their respective categories.

### **Objective:**

Building a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify the monkey species into their respective categories.

### **Data Description:**

This dataset is taken from Kaggle and it consists of the various species of monkeys.
-  Due to the large volume of data, the images were converted to the images.npy file and the labels are also placed in Labels.csv, allowing you to work on the data without being concerned about the large data volume.
- The dataset comprises of 10 monkey species.

**List of Species**
- Mantled Howler
- Patas Monkey
- Bald Monkey
- Japanese Macaque
- Pygmy Marmoset
- White Headed Capuchin
- Silver Marmosetr
- Common Squirrel Monkey
- Black Headed Night Monkey
- Nilgiri Langur
